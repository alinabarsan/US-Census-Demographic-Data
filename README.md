# US-Census-Demographic-Data
Tableau

This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it includes the census data for all counties in 2015.

You are required to create three visualizations. Some questions you may attempt to answer include those pertaining to the following areas:

Which states have the best transportation?

This is a fairly subjective question, so your first job is to define what the best transportation is.
Is it the highest percentage of transit use? 
Is it the lowest mean commute times? 
Then you need to determine how to aggregate the data from the county level to the state. 
Are there outlier counties affecting the data? How should you aggregate all the data from the counties to represent the state effectively? 
How does income and poverty look across America?

Build a dashboard or story to answer your question and lead viewers to that answer.
